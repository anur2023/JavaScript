# ⏱️ Async Counter with Delay

A simple JavaScript project that increases a counter after a 1-second delay using **Promises** and **async/await**.

This project demonstrates how `setTimeout` can be wrapped inside a Promise and used with `await` to create delayed execution.

## 📌 Project Description

When the user clicks a button, the counter does not increase immediately.  
Instead, it waits for **1 second** and then increments the value by 1.

This helps in understanding asynchronous behavior in JavaScript.
