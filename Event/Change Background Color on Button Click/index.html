        Aarav lived in a small village surrounded by golden fields and tall mango trees. Every evening, he climbed the old banyan tree near his house and watched the sunset paint the sky in shades of orange and pink. Aarav dreamed of becoming a pilot, flying above clouds and seeing the world. One day, a broken kite fell into his hands, tangled in the branches. Instead of throwing it away, Aarav repaired it with patience and care. When the kite finally flew high, Aarav smiled proudly. He realized that with determination and belief, even simple dreams can rise and touch the sky.
