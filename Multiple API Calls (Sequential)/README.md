# 🔗 Multiple API Calls (Sequential)

A simple JavaScript project that demonstrates how to make **multiple API calls in sequence**, where the second API depends on the result of the first API.

In this project, we first fetch a user and then fetch posts belonging to that user.

## 📌 Project Description

This application allows the user to enter a User ID.  
After clicking the button:

1. The application fetches user details  
2. Using the user's ID, it fetches all posts created by that user  
3. Displays user info and posts on the page  

This project focuses on understanding **sequential API calls**, **async/await**, and **data dependency**.
